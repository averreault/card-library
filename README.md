# card-library README

This was created to keep track of my programs for a card library for 
my final project in EECE 2140


## Contents

This repository should contain the following folders/files:
- card.py - class that contains the identities to  create each unique card
- deck.py - class that contains class tha creates deck and general methods for card games
- player.py - class that intializes a player created so games with multiple players could be added to future games but utlized in current games
- war.py - contains the program for the game of war
- blackjack.py - contains the program for the game of blackjack
- Driver.py - contains the driver for the card game library, created so the expandiblity was more easily accessable. 
- Card_lib_test.py - unit_test file
